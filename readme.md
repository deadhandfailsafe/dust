## Features
The following are implemented so far:
- A realistic firearm hit distribution system for skirmish scale combat paired with matching extreme lethality.
- An Escape From Tarkov influenced health point per limb and bleeding system.
- A detailed medical system for damage to specific limbs: Collapse lungs, go blind, be unable to walk again!
- Randomly Generated soldiers, both in stature and skill.
- Abstracted battle spaces for each encounter that work on a non-gridded system and allow soldier skills to shine as they seek cover and concealment.
